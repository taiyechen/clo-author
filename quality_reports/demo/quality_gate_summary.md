## Weighted Aggregate: 76.3/100

## Gate Result: BLOCKED

```
Commit gate (>= 80):    FAIL  -- 76.3 < 80
PR gate (>= 90):        FAIL  -- 76.3 < 90
Submission gate (>= 95): FAIL  -- 76.3 < 95
```

## Blocking Components

### Identification validity: 61/100
**Source:** strategist-critic strategy review
**Critical issues:** (1) Exposure index conflates displacement with augmentation — estimand is ambiguous. (2) Pre-trends begin 2019, three years before ChatGPT launch.
**Resolution required:** Decompose exposure into substitution/complementarity components. Implement Rambachan & Roth (2023) sensitivity analysis. Re-run strategy review after fix.

### Paper quality: 72/100
**Source:** Average of domain-referee (73) and methods-referee (71)
**Key concerns:** Both referees flag the exposure decomposition as essential. Methods referee additionally flags missing shift-share diagnostics (Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. 2020) and result fragility (3 of 22 SOC groups drive the finding).
**Resolution required:** Address MUST items from editor decision letter. Re-run peer review after revision.

## Passing Components (Detail)

### Literature coverage: 85/100
- Core AI-and-labor papers cited (Acemoglu & Restrepo 2020, Webb 2020, Felten et al. 2023, Eloundou et al. 2023)
- Shift-share methodology covered (Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. 2020, Borusyak et al. 2022, Adao et al. 2019)
- Deduction: -8 for missing Brynjolfsson et al. (2025) augmentation evidence; -7 for no engagement with Noy & Zhang (2023) or Peng et al. (2023) experimental results showing productivity gains

### Data quality: 89/100
- CPS monthly files linked correctly; occupation crosswalks documented
- O*NET task content mapped to SOC codes with version control
- GPT capability scoring methodology documented and replicable
- Deduction: -6 for no discussion of CPS self-employment exclusion bias; -5 for GPT self-assessment circularity not addressed

### Code quality: 82/100
- Scripts numbered and structured (01_build_exposure, 02_build_panel, 03_estimate, 04_figures, 05_tables)
- Reproducible: set.seed(20250301) at top, here() for all paths
- Deductions: -10 for missing Adao et al. (2019) SEs in shift-share estimation (code-strategy alignment); -5 for no RDS checkpoint after exposure index construction (takes 45 min with GPT API calls); -3 for figure title inside ggplot (INV-12)

### Manuscript polish: 87/100
- Clean LaTeX, booktabs throughout, threeparttable on all tables
- Notation consistent (E_ot for employment, alpha_o for exposure, tau for treatment effect)
- Deductions: -8 for abstract at 168 words (exceeds 150-word invariant INV-5); -5 for inconsistent use of "effect" vs. "association" — Section 5 uses causal language but Section 6 hedges with correlational language for the same estimates

### Replication readiness: 100/100 (PASS)
- All scripts run from project root
- No absolute paths, no prohibited functions
- CPS extract code included with IPUMS variable list
- O*NET version and download date documented
- README includes GPT API model version (gpt-4-0613) and expected cost ($12.40 for task scoring)

## Recommended Action

The two critical issues are linked. Decomposing the exposure index (Issue 1) will likely also address the pre-trends concern (Issue 2) — if the substitution component shows a clean break at 2022Q4 while the complementarity component shows the pre-trend, the paper's identification is rescued and the finding becomes more interesting.

Estimated post-fix aggregate: 85-91/100 (clears commit gate, potentially clears PR gate depending on how decomposition affects referee scores).
